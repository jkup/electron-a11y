# Electron a11y

This is a demo project for an electron accessibility talk.

## Installing

```
git clone git@github.com:jkup/electron-a11y.git
cd electron-a11y
npm install
npm run start
```

Then click on the console tab of the developer tools and paste in:

```
require('devtron').install()
```

Which will expose a Devtron tab in your devtools. Click on that and then accessibility! (You may have to refresh the page)
